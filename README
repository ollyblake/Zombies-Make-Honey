this is an image upload site for 'Zombies Make Honey'

Problem:

Have wanted to make this a multiple image upload site since the start but have had trouble. 
I put it down to my lack of PHP knowledge. I have tried setting up 'image[]' in each file input 
and then going through a foreach loop but keep running into problems when I try to check the
image array with gif, jpg, jpeg file types. 

The code at the moment is a bit messy because I started coding it to add a single file form  
rather than a multiple file form. Any help is greatly apriciated.
